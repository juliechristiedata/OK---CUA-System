COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Kristen L. Behrens, Esquire, as Administrator of the Estate of Yaseem Jenkins
(“Decedent”), a minor, on behalf of his Heirs-at-Law and Next-of-Kin, N.J. and N.I., his minor Case ID: 221101335
siblings, for this complaint against Defendants Turning Points for Children; Turning Points for Children CUA 5, LLC; and The Turning Points for Children Charitable Foundation,
(collectively, “Turning Points Defendants”) alleges as follows:
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
1.

Since Decedent was born, Turning Points Defendants were responsible for
ensuring his safety and well-being. They failed to do so, and thus caused or contributed to his death less than four years later.

2.

Before Decedent celebrated his first birthday, his biological father brought him to
an illegal drug deal, where he sustained multiple gunshot wounds that resulted in life-threating injuries and serious medical needs. But Turning Points Defendants knew or should have known that an unreasonable threat to Decedent’s safety and well-being existed as long as his biological father had access to him, given his father’s prior guilty plea to a firearm-related felony.

3.

After Decedent was shot, Turning Points Defendants knew or should have known
that his medical needs required a heightened degree of care, such as an appropriate medical foster home. And they owed or undertook a duty to meet those needs through identifying,
selecting, training, or supervising Decedent’s foster care placement.

4.

Rather than meeting Decedent’s needs, Turning Points Defendants’ pattern of
negligence continued in that he ultimately died from the gunshot wounds’ complications upon being placed in a non-medical foster home.

PARTIES
5.

Decedent is a deceased minor who was born on November 13, 2018 and died on
April 19, 2022. At all relevant times, he was a citizen of Pennsylvania.

Case ID: 221101335
6.

Kristen L. Behrens, Esquire, is a licensed attorney in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania with a business address at 1500 Market Street, Suite 3500E, Philadelphia,
Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania 19102 and has been appointed to serve as Administrator of Decedent’s estate.

7.

Turning Points for Children (“Turning Points”) is a Pennsylvania nonprofit
corporation with a principal place of business at 415 South 15th Street, Philadelphia,
Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania 19146 and regularly conducts business in Philadelphia
County.

8.

Turning Points for Children CUA 5, LLC (“Turning Points CUA 5”) is a
Pennsylvania limited liability company with a principal place of business at 415 South 15th Street, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania 19146 and regularly conducts business in Philadelphia County.

9.

The Turning Points for Children Charitable Foundation (“Turning Points
Charitable Foundation”) is a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation with a principal place of business at 415 South 15th Street, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania 19146 and regularly conducts business in Philadelphia County.

10.

Together, Turning Points Defendants made up a corporate structure that included
parent entities, parent corporations, franchisors, franchises, associated or affiliated corporations, member corporations, or subsidiary corporations.

11.

At all relevant times, Turning Points Defendants acted, or failed to act, by and
through their employees, agents, servants or subcontractors, including, but not limited to, social workers, case managers, case workers, case supervisors, directors or therapists, to facilitate, enable, or otherwise cause Decedent’s death. Accordingly, they are liable for the acts or Case ID: 221101335
omissions of their employees, agents, servants, subcontractors, or other representatives as set forth below, under theories of agency, master-servant, respondeat superior, or right of control.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
12.

The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County has original jurisdiction over
this action under 42 Pa. C.S. § 931(a), which vests unlimited original jurisdiction of all actions in the Court unless an appropriate statute or rule provides otherwise.

13.

Philadelphia County constitutes a proper venue for three reasons: (1) Turning
Points Defendants regularly conduct business in Philadelphia County. (2) The cause of action arose in Philadelphia County. (3) A transaction or occurrence out of which the cause of action arose took place in Philadelphia County. See Pa. R. Civ. P. 2156(a), 2179(a).

STATEMENT OF FACTS
14.

The City of Philadelphia established the Department of Human Services, Children
and Youth Division (“DHS”) to “provide and promote safety, permanency, and well-being for children and youth at risk of abuse [and] neglect.” See City of Philadelphia,
https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-human-services/ (last visited Nov. 7, 2022).

15.

Under Pennsylvania’s Child Protective Services Law, 23 Pa. C.S. § 6301, et seq. , DHS may purchase and use the services of any public or private agency to provide services to children, youth, and families involved with Philadelphia’s child welfare system, including in-home protective services, kinship services, and foster care services.

16.

At all relevant times, DHS purchased and used, or otherwise availed itself of,
Turning Points Defendants’ services as a community umbrella agency (“CUA”).

17.

About seven years before Decedent’s birth, his biological father, Nafis Monroe
a/k/a Nafes Monroe, was arrested and charged with two firearm-related offenses, including a top Case ID: 221101335
count of carrying a firearm without a license (a third-degree felony). In response, Monroe pled guilty and received a sentence highlighted by six to twelve months of confinement. See Commw.

v. Monroe, CP-51-CR-014203-2012 (Phila. Cnty. Ct. Com. Pl.).

18.

About six years later and thus about one year before Decedent’s birth, DHS
referred Decedent’s family, including his biological mother Tiffany Jenkins, for CUA services.

Following the referral, Turning Points Defendants began providing the same to the family.

19.

As Turning Points Defendants provided their services to the family, Jenkins gave
birth to Decedent on November 13, 2018.

20.

In so providing, Turning Points Defendants owed or undertook a duty to ensure
Decedent’s safety and well-being.

21.

At or around the time of Decedent’s birth, Jenkins positively showed several
significant risk factors, which, individually or in any combination, undermined her ability to adequately care for Decedent: (1) She received no prenatal care. (2) She admitted ingesting illegal drugs during her pregnancy. (3) She disregarded professionally recommended mental health treatment.

22.

After Decedent’s birth, Jenkins’ poor decision making continued, as she allowed
Decedent’s biological father to have access to Decedent, even though he had been convicted of a firearm-related felony.

23.

In permitting such access, on October 19, 2019, then-less-than-one-year-old
Decedent was shot multiple times during a drug deal gone awry after his biological father tried to use counterfeit currency.

24.

That Decedent was shot in the first instance underscores Turning Points
Defendants’ negligence, which directly and proximately caused Decedent’s death: They failed to Case ID: 221101335
identify, assess, and respond to the serious risk of harm to Decedent as long as Monroe had access to him.

25.

After emergency responders rendered immediate medical aid, Decedent required
high-level medical care for over six months from several providers, including St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Seashore House.

26.

Upon being discharged, Turning Points Defendants knew or should have known
that Decedent’s serious medical needs required him to be placed in a setting that could meet those needs, such as an appropriate medical foster home. And Turning Points Defendants
remained responsible for Decedent’s safety and well-being in this setting, including but not limited to (1) identifying it; (2) selecting it; (3) placing Decedent in it, or causing Decedent to be placed in it; (4) training the medical foster parent; or (5) otherwise supervising or overseeing the placement.

27.

Decedent was thus placed in the medical foster home of Wisdith Civil.

28.

But Civil could not adequately meet Decedent’s serious medical needs, in that she
engaged in behavior that both compounded his already-serious medical needs and reflected her unfitness as Decedent’s foster parent: At least once, she refused to come out of her home with Decedent. She also refused to let Turning Points Defendants transport Decedent to a visit with his biological mother. And she arrived late for a visit because she got stuck at a “stop sign” on Interstate 95, which has no stop signs.

29.

As a result, Decedent was removed from Civil’s care or custody, and he was
placed in the home of a non-medical foster parent, Lenora Seyes, who resided at 6501 North 7th Street, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania 19126.

Case ID: 221101335
30.

Because Decedent’s serious medical needs persisted, so too did the need for a
placement that could meet those needs, which Seyes’ non-medical foster home was not.

31.

Indeed, Seyes herself was not certified or trained as a medical foster parent. Thus,
Decedent’s placement in her home was inappropriate.

32.

Turning Points Defendants’ systemic negligence reached a tipping point on April
19, 2019: Seyes found Decedent inside his crib with vomitus and aspiration after eating, and later he was pronounced dead due to complications from the gunshot wounds and improper
supervision.

33.

At all relevant times, Turning Points Defendants knew or should have known of
the foreseeable and unreasonable threat to Decedent’s safety and well-being that existed as long as his biological father had access to him because such access could directly and proximately cause serious injuries, including death.

34.

At all relevant times, Turning Points Defendants knew or should have known of
the heightened degree of medical care that Decedent required due to his serious medical needs, and that improperly identifying, selecting, training, or supervising his placement, like a non-medical foster home, could directly and proximately cause serious injuries, including death.

35.

In sum, the foreseeable and unreasonable risk of harm manifested itself when
Decedent died from the risk that demanded a heightened degree of medical attention, the gunshot wounds.

36.

But for Turning Points Defendants’ actions or inactions, including the same of
their employees, agents, servants, or other representatives, Decedent would not have died on April 19, 2022.

Case ID: 221101335
37.

Turning Points Defendants’ negligence solely and exclusively caused Decedent’s
death.

38.

No act or omission by Decedent contributed to the same.
