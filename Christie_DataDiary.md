Reorganized the document Steve put together to group the analysis I need to do by theme/questions its answering instead of the data source I'll be using. This organization is:

1. Lawsuit database -- to explore how people have saught accountability through suing the CUA System
2. Abuse rates of children once inside the system -- understand the rates and disparities between data at the state and federal levels; understand where Philly lands compared to the rest of the state
3. Casey Foundation call to reduce foster care population by 50% since 2010 -- to understand how many families may not have needed separation at all
4. Berkeley Media Studies on foster care panic -- to understand what the research shows and how it can incorporate into the story

Set up everything and created a timeline in Asana.
