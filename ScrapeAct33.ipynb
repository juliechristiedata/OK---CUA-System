    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Pennsylvania publishes reports on child fatalities and near fatalities as a result of child abuse. The reports include the age, sex, county, and date of the incident, as well as whether the family was known to the local department of human/family services in the 16 months preceding the incident. The detailed reports are organized online in a way that can be scraped for some, but not all of the information. The first page of the `.pdf` reports contain the rest of the necessary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, Resolve is looking to understand the frequency at which children who experience abuse that results in their death/near death are already known to the system. We are exploring these rates at the county level to understand what the statewide trend is, and whether Philadelphia exceeds that trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Act 146** -- *\"Act 146 of 2006 went into effect on May 8, 2007. A major provision of this law requires that the department prepare a non-identifying summary for the governor and the General Assembly of findings for each case of substantiated child abuse or neglect that has resulted in a child fatality or near fatality.\"*\n",
    "-   **Near fatality** -- *Definition TKTK*\n",
    "-   **DA De-certification** -- *This gets assigned to a report when the District Attorney determines that the incident was not a result of child abuse.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Child Fatality/Near Fatality Reports](https://www.dhs.pa.gov/docs/OCYF/Pages/Fatality-Reports.aspx) --- A table of the reports with some information and URLs to the actual reports. | No metadata available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Python](python.org) -- *Base code to facilitate scraping*\n",
    "-   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) -- *More robust data anlysis*\n",
    "-   [Regex](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions) -- *Regular Expressions, or Regex, to parse out patterns of characters*\n",
    "-   [PDF Plumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) -- *Parse information from .pdf files*\n",
    "-   [Web Scraper](https://www.webscraper.io/documentation?utm_source=extension&utm_medium=popup) -- *Scrape data from a webpage*\n",
    "-   [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/p/excel/cfq7ttc0hr4r?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) -- *Clean and analyze tabulated data*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- A \"certifying pysician\" makes an individual call on whether a child's death/near death is the result of abuse, meaning that human error may result in cases not being documented in these reports\n",
    "- Child fatalities and near fatalities as a result of abuse are an incredibly small and extreme subset of the overall abuse that children face.\n",
    "- Counties not recorded in scraped data pre-2016; 764 cases need counties assigned\n",
    "- 922 Reports have URLs that indicate they have been de-certified and therefore have no report details. These all share one of 6 common URLs:\n",
