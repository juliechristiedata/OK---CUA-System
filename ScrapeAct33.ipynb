    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Pennsylvania's Act 146 reports have a fairly standardized structure to how they are written. Therefore, this code will attempt to scrape the narrative `.pdf` documents and turn them into structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, Resolve is looking to understand the frequency at which children who experience abuse that results in their death/near death are already known to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Act 146** -- *\"Act 146 of 2006 went into effect on May 8, 2007. A major provision of this law requires that the department prepare a non-identifying summary for the governor and the General Assembly of findings for each case of substantiated child abuse or neglect that has resulted in a child fatality or near fatality.\"*\n",
    "-   **Near fatality** -- *Definition TKTK*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Quarterly Summaries of Child Fatalities/Near Fatalities](https://www.dhs.pa.gov/docs/Publications/Pages/Quarterly-Summaries-Child-Abuse.aspx) --- *A narrative `.pdf` document that describes the fatalities and near fatalities of children as a result of abuse or neglect.* \\| [Metadata](URL)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Python](python.org) -- *Base code to facilitate scraping*\n",
    "-   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) -- *More robust data anlysis*\n",
    "-   [Regex](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions) -- *Regular Expressions, or Regex, to parse out patterns of characters*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- A \"certifying pysician\" makes an individual call on whether a child's death/near death is the result of abuse, meaning that human error may result in cases not being documented in these reports\n",
    "- Child fatalities and near fatalities as a result of abuse are an incredibly small and extreme subset of the overall abuse that children face."
