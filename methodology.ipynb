    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Pennsylvania publishes reports on child fatalities and near fatalities that the state determined were a result of child abuse. The reports include the age, sex, county, and date of the incident, as well as whether the family was previously known to the local department of human/family services. The detailed reports are all published online, however scraping those may prove to be more complicated than scraping the quarterly reports. These reports are written in a narrative format that is consistent throughout the entire quarterly report. The structure of these narrative summaries can change between reports, making scraping this also complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, Resolve is looking to understand the frequency at which children who experience abuse that results in their death/near death are already known to the system. We are exploring these rates at the county level to understand what the statewide trend is, and how Philadelphia measures up to that trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Act 146** -- *\"Act 146 of 2006 went into effect on May 8, 2007. A major provision of this law requires that the department prepare a non-identifying summary for the governor and the General Assembly of findings for each case of substantiated child abuse or neglect that has resulted in a child fatality or near fatality.\"*\n",
    "-   **Near fatality** -- *Definition TKTK, which is determined by the \"certifying physician\" from the state.*\n",
    "-   **DA De-certification** -- *This gets assigned to a report when the District Attorney determines that the incident was not a result of child abuse.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Child Fatality/Near Fatality Quarterly Reports](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dhs/resources/data-reports/quarterly-summaries-child-abuse.html) --- A collection of brief summaries of fatalities/near fatalities of children due to abuse. | No metadata available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Python](python.org) -- *Base code to facilitate scraping*\n",
    "-   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) -- *More robust data anlysis*\n",
    "-   [Regex](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions) -- *Regular Expressions, or Regex, to parse out patterns of characters*\n",
    "-   [PDF Plumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) -- *Parse information from .pdf files*\n",
    "-   [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/p/excel/cfq7ttc0hr4r?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) -- *Clean and analyze tabulated data*\n",
    "-   [R](https://www.r-project.org/) -- *Clean and analyze data*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- A \"certifying pysician\" makes an individual call on whether a child's death/near death is the result of abuse, meaning that human error may result in cases not being documented in these reports\n",
    "- Child fatalities and near fatalities as a result of abuse are an incredibly small and extreme subset of the overall abuse that children face. This analysis does not constitute a full picture, but rather is a snapshot of what the state deemed the most egregious cases.\n",
    "- These quarterly reports may not contain all instances. A previous scrape of individual reports rendered about 2,400 reports. This scrape yielded 1,434 reports in quarterly summaries.\n",
    "- The Quarterly Reports are incomplete. The following are missing quarterly reports:\n",
    "  - 2011 Q4\n",
    "  - 2012 Q4\n",
    "  - 2014 Q4\n",
    "  - 2015 Q4\n",

    "\n",
    "> 1. A `##-age-old` `sex` child `died/nearly died` on `date` as a result of .... `Agency Name` indicated the report on ... naming the victim child's `identifier for relationship` as the perpetrator(s). ... Further details of the incident are written out. ...  The family `was/was not known` to child welfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this phrasing changes to things like \"On `date` a `##-age-old` `sex` child `died/nearly died` ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The regex must also take into account any instances where a sibiling is mentioned with a similar structure, like \"the victim's ##-age-old sibling was present at the time.\""
