However, the one consistency in theaccounts was that the father was startled from sleeping, jumped out of bed andaccidentally kicked the child, who was lying on the floor, to the head. It was determinedthrough the investigation with supporting medical evidence that these accounts wereinconsistent with the child’s injuries and that the injuries were somehow inflicted. As theparents were the sole caretakers at the time of the incident, they were both heldresponsible. The child has since been discharged from the hospital and is residing witha maternal aunt. The child does not have any siblings. This family was not known tothe county agency prior to the incident. There is a criminal investigation pending."

The cause and manner of the child’s death are unknown at this time.  The Western Region Office of Children, Youth, and Families substantiated the report for medical neglect in April 2013 and listed the child’s maternal aunt, a maternal female cousin, and the maternal aunt’s paramour as perpetrators.  The victim child and his twin brother had sustained chemical burns.  The victim child also had scratches on various parts of his body.  Inconsistent reports have been provided by the caregivers as to how and when the children sustained the burns.  It has been reported that the children were sleeping in their crib and the victim child soiled himself.  The victim child and his sibling were removed from the crib and the crib and bedding were cleaned with bleach.  The victim child and his sibling were then placed back into the crib.  The children started to cry and were removed from the crib and placed on the living room floor with their eight year old brother and their six year old cousin.  The maternal female cousin’s two children (ages two and 23 months) were also on the floor sleeping.  The boys were propped up on pillows.  The caregivers allegedly noticed the victim child had redness to his stomach.  The maternal aunt left the home to go drinking and left the boys in the care of her paramour and the maternal cousin.  The mother was notified by the maternal aunt that there had been an incident in the home involving bleach but the boys were fine.  The mother then came to the home hours later (around 5:00 am) and saw the victim child unresponsive.  It was reported that all three caregivers were under the influence of marijuana.  The mother was determined to be under the influence of alcohol.  The aunt’s paramour called an ambulance to the home at approximately 6:00 am on March 2 because the victim child was found unresponsive.  The victim child was already deceased when the ambulance arrived and was taken directly to the medical examiner’s office.  The sibling was taken to the hospital, where he was admitted and treated for his injuries.  The investigation determined that the caregivers initially considered notifying emergency personnel but had decided not to.  The county has been involved with the family for various reasons since 2008.  The mother has a history of inpatient mental health hospitalizations, outpatient psychotherapy, and substance abuse evaluations.  The father was incarcerated prior to this incident due to drug-related issues.  Most recently, the county became involved due to the mother making threats of self-harm, and allegations of substance abuse.  The county opened services with the family in April 2012.  The children were placed in the care of their maternal aunt at the beginning of Oct. 2012 due to being left home alone by the mother.  The county then removed the boys from the maternal aunt’s home after determining she had previously been convicted on a child endangerment charge.  Despite the aunt’s criminal record, a judge  ordered the children back into the care of the maternal aunt after a hearing on Oct. 12, 2012.  Due to the aunt’s criminal conviction, she was unable to become a licensed kinship provider.  The county was providing oversight of the boys and their placement in the aunt’s home at the time of the incident.  There have not been any charges filed in this report pending the final autopsy report."

School records show that the nurse attempted on numerousoccasions to contact the father with concerns about the child’s health without success,the lack of cooperation by the father was noted each time. While in the hospital thechild was listed in critical condition and monitored around the clock for possible re-feeding syndrome. A report was immediately called into ChildLine from the hospital atwhich time the investigation began. The victim child is autistic and completely non-verbal; therefore he was unable to be interviewed. The victim child is completelydependent on others for all his needs. When the father and his paramour, bothconsidered full-time caretakers of the child, were interviewed regarding the child’sweight loss they were unable to present any reasonable medical explanation. Bothcaretakers stated that the child was very difficult to feed and when he refused to eatthey gave him PediaSure and eventually Ensure. Neither caretaker showed any effort2013 1st Quarter FatalitiesJanuary 1 – March 31 2013 10to help the child eat after he became frustrated, and indicated that they then becamefrustrated with the child in turn. The victim child’s father refused to take responsibilityfor the child’s weight loss. The victim child’s treating physician concluded that the onlyplausible explanation for the child’s condition was a lack of nutrition due to starving.The county agency obtained custody of the victim child and he is currently placed with aprogram offering pediatric specialty care where they are able to monitor the child aroundthe clock. The child has gained weight since placement with the staff reporting that attimes he is difficult to feed, but redirection is used with success. The staff stated thatthe child’s behavior improved significantly with their only technique being to address thechild’s needs in a timely manner. The family was known to the county agency prior tothis incident for truancy, lack of parenting skills, and possible neglect due to the hygieneissues. Each time a report was made the family was contacted and voluntary serviceswere opened to help build parenting skills. There are three other siblings in thehousehold and after ensuring there were no safety risks they were kept in their father’scustody. The children’s biological mother is not involved and attempts to contact her viaa last known address have been unsuccessful. The investigation concluded that afailure to respond to the victim child’s nutritional needs resulted in physical neglect inthe form of severe malnutrition. A revised family service plan was completed with apermanency goal of reunification with the child’s father, and a concurrent goal ofplacement with a fit and willing relative. There is no law enforcement involvement onthis case.Venango County NOTE: Feb. 2013 is only date given, Feb. 1 assigned as placeholder date to be a logical date to extract"

The Allegheny County Department of Human Services (DHS) substantiated the case in Sept. 2013 listing the mother as a perpetrator of serious physical neglect.  The child had been admitted to the hospital for vomiting in May 2013.  The child was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for 10 days in July after becoming very ill with an unusual infection.  The mother was later observed in the hospital making fake dirty diapers, smearing feces, and tampering with child’s IV line and feeding tube.  It is believed that mother’s actions caused the child to have the infections.  The investigation also determined that while at the hospital, the mother would over exaggerate the child’s medical problems.  During the child’s stay at the hospital, he was subjected to multiple tests, sedations, procedures, blood draws, and other unnecessary risks and treatments.  Later medical testing showed that child had a normal GI system and was able to gain weight.  The mother did admit to the allegations.  The investigation determined that the father was not aware of mother’s actions.  The mother was arrested in Aug. 2013 and was charged with endangering the welfare of a child, recklessly endangering another person, and aggravated assault.  She is currently awaiting trial.  The child was released from the hospital into the care of his father on July 31, 2013.  The child has a three year old brother who also resides in the home. He was determined to be safe in the home.

Philadelphia Department of Human Services substantiated the case in Sept. 2013, naming a babysitter as a perpetrator.  The babysitter stated that the child fell out of her crib on the evening of Aug. 9, 2013 around 11 pm.  The babysitter gave inconsistent information regarding whether or not the child was conscious and breathing when he discovered her.  The babysitter called his paramour, who told him to contact 911.  The babysitter’s paramour went to the father’s home and notified him about the child.  When the babysitter’s paramour and the father arrived at the babysitter’s home the father instructed the babysitter to contact 911.  Neither the babysitter nor the babysitter’s paramour contacted 911 until father arrived at the babysitter’s home.  The babysitter claimed he did not call 911 immediately because the child was responsive and he wanted the paramour to arrive at the home to watch their son while he went to the hospital.  The police were dispatched to the babysitter’s home on Aug. 10 at approximately 12:25 am.  Upon arrival to the hospital, the child was intubated and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  The hospital determined that the child had a subdural hematoma and significant swelling to the brain.  The father had to be removed from the hospital after throwing a chair in the waiting room.  The mother did not come to the hospital until 3:00 am.  The investigation revealed that the child’s injuries were consistent with the explanation of the child falling out of the crib. The child also had a broken collar bone which was consistent with the fall.  However, the child’s condition worsened as a result of not receiving timely medical care.  There was at least an hour and half between when the babysitter discovered the child on the floor and the time that the child arrived at the hospital.  The child now requires a feeding tube and only has peripheral vision.  The child was discharged from the hospital on Nov. 6, 2013, and is now receiving rehabilitation services and attending a medical daycare.  The hospital also noted that the child had bruises to her left torso and right toenail, a blister on the left heel, and diaper rash; however, the mother provided reasonable explanations for these injuries.  Philadelphia Department of Human Services received a separate general report from the hospital on Sept. 9, 2013, after they discovered a healed burn on the child’s left arm.  The mother stated that the child was burned approximately 8 months ago when the child brushed up against a heater.  The report alleged that the parents made two doctor’s appointments to have the burn treated, but did not take the child.  The mother said she treated the burn with ointment.  Although Philadelphia Department of Human Services determined that the parents did not seek medical treatment for the child’s burn, the condition of the burn did not worsen as a result, and has now healed completely.  The child has a three-year-old sister who was examined and determined to be in good health.  Philadelphia Department of Human Services has placed the child and her sibling with a paternal aunt due to concerns for neglect and domestic violence between the parents.  The mother and father have supervised visits.  The family is currently receiving case management services, and both parents were referred to counseling.  Philadelphia Department of Human Services also assessed the safety of the babysitter’s one-year-old male child, who did not show any signs of abuse or neglect.  He was placed with a grandmother while the case was under investigation, but has since returned home, and no services are being provided to his family.  Neither of the families had a prior history of involvement with Philadelphia Department of Human Services.  There are no criminal charges related to this case at this time."

Union County Children and Youth Services (CYS) indicated the case in Sept. 2013 and named the child’s biological father as the perpetrator.  The father stated the child fell backwards about three feet off of a bed onto the hardwood floor and landed on his head.  When the child began to show signs of losing consciousness his father called 911.  Emergency services transported the child to a local hospital, where he was eventually flown via Life Flight to a larger hospital.  After completing a full evaluation on the child it was determined he was suffering from a subdural hematoma but showed no sign of external trauma or bruising.  A small portion of his skull was removed to relieve the pressure and he was placed on a ventilator and has since recovered.  Physicians at the first hospital the child went to report that the father’s story is plausible, but a neurosurgeon at the second hospital stated the injury was non-accidental trauma to the head.  The family is known in their community and has large support system, including the local church and extended family from out of town that have flown in to help them.  The family has no history with Union County CYS.

At the request of the father’s paramour the child was taken, via ambulance, to the Clearfield Hospital emergency room. The child was examined and Clearfield Hospital medical staff determined she was in critical condition but expected to survive. Several hours later hospital staff transferred the child to Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHOP), via medical helicopter, where she was declared brain dead and died of abusive head trauma. The child suffered bilateral subdural hematomas and retinal hemorrhaging. Physicians at CHOP diagnosed the injuries to be a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome and stated the child’s condition was impacted by the delay in medical treatment. During the CCCYFS investigation it was discovered that the father had taken the child to the Dubois Medical Center emergency room the evening of Nov. 14, 2013, due to the child vomiting and bruising under her eyes that he described as “raccoon eyes”.

Fayette County Children and Youth Services (FCCYS) indicated the report on Jan. 18, 2014, naming both parents as perpetrators of abuse. The child was taken to the Uniontown Hospital on the morning of Nov. 15, 2013, because the mother said she wasn’t “acting right” and had been vomiting since the previous day. Upon examination the child was found to have multiple bruises to the center of her abdomen and left side and her stomach was distended. The parents denied any knowledge of how the injuries occurred claiming the child woke up in that condition. She was intubated and transferred to Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHOP) by medical helicopter where an examination found the child’s liver and spleen were both lacerated. Emergency surgery was performed but could not save the child’s life at which time a report was made to ChildLine. FCCYS immediately conducted a safety assessment where it was determined the three siblings were not safe in the home and were placed in foster care. On Dec. 4, 2013, the children were transferred to the care of their maternal great grandparents who were assessed and approved as appropriate caregivers by FCCYS. Prior to this incident, FCCYS had received five reports involving this family. A report was made in Jan. 2013 alleging that one of the children had informed the caller of a thumb sized bruise received when the mother hit the child on the arm. This report was screened out. A report was made in Feb. 2013 alleging the mother left her 9-month-old child unattended in a shopping cart for approximately 10 minutes. A wide burn was also bserved on the child’s hand. The report was screened out. On May 10, 2013, a Child Protective Services report (CPS) was received alleging the 4-year-old was on the porch roof grabbing onto power lines while the mother was inside the house and the father was outside working on his car. FCCYS and a Luzerne Township police officer immediately responded to the home. There were no potential safety threats identified and the children were deemed safe. On May 14, 2013, while working on the previous CPS report from May 10, 2013, another CPS report was made alleging the parents are physically and verbally abusive toward the children and that the children are always unsupervised. The caller stated that a few weeks prior to making this report, the 1-year-old fell down six or seven steps outside when the mother wasn’t watching her and had “bruises and knots” on her head.  The mother stated to the caller that she didn’t want to take her child to the doctor. The caller also referred to allegations in the May 10, 2013, CPS report and added that the children go near a busy road, that the 3-year-old nearly “went under” a running lawn mower after the father walked away, claimed the father buys and sells pills, that the home has no running water and no food. This report was immediately responded to by FCCYS and a Luzerne Township Police officer where all children were seen and no threats were identified.  Both reports were unfounded on June 4, 2013. A report made on Oct. 30, 2013, alleged the family moved “constantly” and the parents were blowing the children’s SSI money on drugs. An immediate response was made but the home was empty as the family had moved. An additional attempt was made to locate the family on Nov. 5, 2013, including a visit to the oldest sibling at school. A new address for the family was given to FCCYS during that visit. FCCYS went to the new address leaving a note on the door for the family to call the caseworker. A neighbor contacted FCCYS saying they believed the family had moved from that home to another home nearby. On Nov. 14, 2013, after repeated attempts, FCCYS was unable to locate the new residence.

Cambria County Children and Youth Services (CYS) substantiated the case in February 2014 naming the child’s biological father as the perpetrator. On the date of incident, emergency services received a 911 call from the perpetrator stating that his daughter had fallen down a wooden stair case and was unresponsive. Emergency responders arrived at the home and stabilized the victim child for transport via ambulance to a local hospital. After initial testing at the hospital the victim was transported via helicopter to a children’s hospital for further testing and treatment. The test results revealed that she sustained severe brain trauma with diffuse, extensive bilateral retinal hemorrhaging, a clavicle fracture, epidural hemorrhaging at the level of the cervical spine, multiple bruises all over her body, and seizures despite treatment with anti-seizure medication. When asked to explain what caused the injuries to the child the father stated she fell down a flight of wooden stairs. He stated that on the day of the incident two of his children were visiting with him at his home, which he shares with his mother. He stated that he and both children were in his attic bedroom playing when he decided to put on a movie. He then reports that he turned his back to put on a movie when he heard “thuds” from the staircase. After running towards the victim child he found her at the bottom of the steps. The perpetrator states that the child initially seemed fine, but eventually went limp and became unresponsive. He reports that he screamed for his brother, who is 10 years old and was home at the time, to come help. The younger brother brought in some water and reportedly screamed at the older brother to call 911. The doctor who treated the victim child at the children’s hospital stated in the report that “these injuries are unequivocally the result of child abuse.  A stair fall could not result in this constellation of injuries.” The victim child’s father states that he did not harm the child and the fall was an accident. After the initial report was received by Cambria County CYS a safety plan was implemented in which the perpetrator’s two other children would have no contact with him during the investigation. Each sibling lives primarily with their biological mother and CYS has no safety concerns for the children while in their mothers’ care. It was recommended to the mother of the perpetrator’s other child, who was with him at the time of incident, that she consent to a full skeletal survey, which she has stated she will not do based on the advice of the perpetrator’s attorney. The safety plan also stated that the perpetrator is to have no contact with his 10 year old brother, who lived in the same home. Police arrested the victim child’s father and charged him with two counts of aggravated assault and one count of endangering the welfare of a child. He is currently incarcerated while awaiting trial.  If the perpetrator is able to post bail he is required to stay with his aunt as there are no children in her home. The Cambria County District Attorney’s Office placed a bail condition on the perpetrator that he is not to have contact with anyone under the age of 18.  The only prior CYS involvement was when the perpetrator was a child. Those reports have all been expunged and there are no current records on file related to this family."

The Philadelphia Department of Human Services (DHS) substantiated the case in April 2014 naming the mother as the perpetrator. The child was born with an endocrine disorder that required her to take cortisone. When the child is ill, she requires higher dosages of the medication, including a shot of cortisone if she is very ill. The child became sick and threw up while at home on March 1, 2014. The mother, who is a nurse, left the child in the care of the aunt so the mother could go to work. The mother did not give the child a higher dosage of cortisone prior to leaving and the aunt was not knowledgeable about the child’s medical condition, only that she took medication. The child continued to vomit and when the mother returned home the child was in shock and had a blood sugar level of 28 (a normal range is 110-200.) At this point the mother should have given the child a shot of cortisone. The mother brought the child to the hospital, where the child was diagnosed with an elevated blood pressure, low blood sugar, and was in adrenal shock. The child was also having difficulty breathing. The mother admitted to hospital staff that the child’s cortisone shot had expired and that she never got a refill. Additionally, through the investigation, it was determined that the mother had poor follow-up care with the hospital that had originally been treating the child. The child was last seen by that hospital in Jan. 2013 but she should have been having quarterly exams. The child was also to receive a neurologic exam prior to this incident but the mother did not follow through with setting up an appointment for the child. The child was discharged from the hospital on March 10, 2014, and DHS filed an Order of Protection and took custody of the child. The child was placed in the kinship care of her godmother and godfather at that time. This family has received education and was given instructions on the child’s necessary medical care. At the time of the incident the child had been residing with her mother, maternal aunt, and a maternal grandfather. She has an older brother, age 8, who also resided in the home. A safety plan was put into place for the older brother that the maternal aunt and grandfather would assist the mother in caring for the brother as he does not have any medical issues. In-home services are being provided to the mother to assist with truancy concerns with the brother. The godparents are supervising all visits between the mother and the victim child. The godparents have been complying with her medical needs, including providing the child with her medications and assuring she gets to medical appointments. A Family Group Decision Making referral has been made but at this time, has not yet taken place. A criminal investigation was conducted; however, no charges have been filed in this case."

On the day of the incident emergency services was called to the mother’s home in the early morning hours of August 5, 2011. The child had been found unresponsive and was declared dead at the scene. Her body was taken directly to the coroner’s office for examination. An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be asphyxiation due to compression of the mouth and neck. The child also sustained blunt force trauma to her head and a fractured right radius and right ulna. She had multiple bruises and lacerations on her body. During the investigation, very little information was provided by the mother or her paramour regarding the circumstances of the child’s death. At the time of the incidents the agency provided a case status of pending criminal court due to the ongoing criminal investigation into the child’s death. On April 17, 2012 the mother plead guilty to one count of recklessly endangering another person. She was sentenced to time served. The judge followed the aggravated range guidelines for sentencing as he felt the mother had failed to provide care and protection of the child. At the time of her release, the mother did not have any other children. Her whereabouts are currently unknown. On Feb. 11, 2014, the mother’s paramour entered an Alford plea for the charge of voluntary manslaughter. This plea means that he maintains his innocence but admits that there was enough evidence against him to likely prove he was responsible for the death of the child. He was sentenced to four to12 years in a state correctional facility. The mother and child were not previously known to the county. However her paramour was known to the county in 2010 for physically abusing his former paramour’s son. As a result of pending criminal charges for that incident, the paramour was being monitored by county probation. Somerset County Children and Youth received a second report while the paramour was residing with his then paramour and their newborn son. This referral was closed in July 2011 after the agency determined there were no safety threats. Probation was still monitoring the case at that time and had no concern about the living situation as long as he was being supervised around his child.

PCCYS substantiated the case on July 29,2014, naming the mother as the perpetrator. The child was born at Children’s Hospital ofPhiladelphia (CHOP) with a mediastinal lymphangioma (benign tumor) in her chest. She was2014 3rd Quarter Fatalities/Near Fatalities 13July 1 – September 30 2014seen again at 3-months-old for an MRI and was doing well. At that time the doctor requestedthe child be seen again at approximately 1-year-old to assess any development of the tumor.The mass could grow and compromise the child’s heart function and ability to breathe. The mother didn’t take the child for a follow-up until Nov. 2013. After several cancellations of thepre-MRI appointment with an anesthesiologist, the child was finally seen for pre-operativeevaluation but never brought back for the MRI. In Apr. 2014 the mother called CHOPrequesting the child be seen due to difficulty breathing, having fevers, and not eating. Themother was instructed to immediately take the child to the local emergency room. Medical stafffrom CHOP followed up and the mother told them the child had been seen at a local urgentcare facility, she had a viral illness and was under the care of her pediatrician. There is norecord of the child being seen by urgent care or the pediatrician. At the request of CHOP thechild was brought to their office at which time she was admitted. Testing revealed a “hugeanterior multilobulated cystic mediastinal mass” compressing her heart. The child was noted tobe ASA Status 4 defined as an “incapacitating disease that is a constant threat to life”.

After beingfound unresponsive in the home of his kinship caregivers January 11 the child wastaken by ambulance to Geisinger Wyoming Valley Hospital Emergency Room. Thechild had what appeared to be burn marks on his legs, different stages of bruisingon his back, bruises on his head, a blown out pupil, and scratches on his face. ACAT scan performed at the hospital showed old and new brain bleeds. The childunderwent surgery to remove blood clots from his brain and died in the operatingroom. The grandmother provided two different explanations for the child’s injuries,stating that he fell off the couch and that he bangs his head when he has tempertantrums. According to the attending medical professionals, neither explanation wasa plausible explanation for the injuries. There were three other children in the careof the maternal grandmother and maternal stepgrandfather at the time of thechild’s death. The two older half siblings were in the legal care and custody of thematernal grandmother and maternal stepgrandfather for the majority of their lives.The child’s full sibling was residing with him in kinship foster care since November2014 when both children were removed from their parents’ care.After the child’s death, all three surviving children were taken into protectivecustody and are residing in the same foster home. During the course of theinvestigation, it was determined that the child’s full sibling had a fractured clavicleand bruising to his lower back. This initiated a separate investigation, and neither2015 1st Quarter Fatalities/Near FatalitiesJanuary 1 – March 31, 2015 5the maternal grandmother nor maternal stepgrandfather could provide anexplanation for the sibling’s injuries.

Services arebeing provided to the maternal grandmother and maternal stepgrandfather in aneffort to return the child’s older siblings, whom they had custody of, to their care.The parents have also been referred for counseling services. LCCYA had received six referrals on this family between October 2010 and January 2014. The referralswere regarding the child’s two half siblings, who were residing with their parents atthe time; the child; and his full sibling. The allegations included: lack ofsupervision, inappropriate discipline, physical injuries, frequent illness, neglect,dirty and unlivable housing conditions, and developmental issues regarding all ofthe children. All six of the reports were closed as the allegations wereunsubstantiated. However, the parents were referred to a parenting program andparticipated in early intervention services for the children. Another referral wasreceived in March 2014 which led to the family remaining open for GPS with LCCYA.Concerns included: the condition of the home, inappropriate sleeping arrangementsfor the children, parents partying and allowing people to stay at their house,drinking and playing loud music, fighting between the mother and father,developmental delays of the children, one of the children reportedly grabbingwomen’s crotches, inappropriate dressing of the children, and the children’sfrequent illness. Continued concern for the welfare of the children resulted in theNovember 2014 placement of the child and his full sibling with the maternalgrandmother and maternal stepgrandfather.

The hospital wasinformed by the Clinic that the child had been a patient with them for years and thechild was prescribed a medication for an immune deficiency. The parents were notproviding the child the medication as required which was making him extremelyvulnerable to infectious diseases. The child’s lack of medication for his medicalcondition has a direct correlation with why he continues to become ill and presentwith diagnoses such as pneumonia and bacterial infections.Lancaster CYA completed safety assessments on the child’s four siblings and had noconcerns for their safety while in the care of their parents.
