A 1-year-old male child died on May 5, 2015, as a result of physical abuse.Lycoming County Children and Youth Services (LCCYS) indicated the report on June19 naming the mother’s paramour as the perpetrator.On the day of the incident, the child was taken to Jersey Shore Hospital by theparamour, who reported that he had dropped the child, causing him to hit his headand become unresponsive. The child was sent by helicopter to Geisinger MedicalCenter. The child died later that night in the pediatric intensive care unit afterundergoing surgery to try to relieve the compression on his brain from a largesubdural hematoma. The child suffered severe cranial and spinal cord injuries,which were bilateral and a result of a significant level of force. The attendingphysician determined the child’s death to be a non-accidental trauma. Thisdetermination was made as the medical findings did not coincide with theexplanation of the injuries. Later autopsy findings showed internal bruising andbleeding in the child’s mid-section, particularly the liver and pancreas.The mother was at work when the incident occurred. She noted that her paramourwould often care for the child while she was working and she did not believe that he2015 2nd Quarter Fatalities/Near FatalitiesApril 1 – June 30, 2015 4would intentionally harm the child. The mother’s paramour provided variousdifferent accounts of what happened to the child, which included: tossing the childin the air and not catching him; and performing wrestling moves with the child byattempting to slam him onto the bed, but missing the bed. The mother’sparamour’s sister, her paramour, and her three children were also living in thehome with the family. The sister’s paramour was in the shower at the time of theincident and did not witness what happened, but tried to resuscitate theunresponsive child when the child was brought to his attention. He then drove thechild and the mother’s paramour to the hospital. Neither the child’s mother nor themother’s paramour had any other children residing in the home. LCCYS was able toensure the safety of the mother’s paramour’s sister’s three children and thechildren were able to remain with their caregivers in the home. The mother wasoffered supportive services and was able to secure counseling. This family wasknown to LCCYS. In July 2014 a GPS referral was received regarding unsanitary andunsafe home conditions. These allegations were not able to be validated, so LCCYSended its involvement with the family. Another GPS referral was received inJanuary 2015 regarding similar concerns for the condition of the home and that themother was not feeding the child. LCCYS made numerous attempts to meet withthe family and discovered that they had relocated to Clinton County. A referral wasmade to Clinton County Children and Youth Services (CCCYS). CCCYS was not ableto validate the concerns and closed the case in mid-February.

A full examination was performed uponadmission and no other physical injuries were discovered. The child requiredsurgery to drain the fluid from his head. Medical staff noted that the child’s headcircumference was growing normally until his two-month checkup, when his headhad grown considerably. This is when they believe that the child’s first bleedoccurred. The child’s head had also increased in size at his next checkup, which ledto the referral for further testing. The parents and child’s caregivers wereinterviewed. Though the mother provided information regarding possible eventsthat could have resulted in head trauma, none of these explanations wereconsistent with the medical findings and no other explanations were offered for theinjuries by either parent or any of the child’s caregivers.The events as reported by the child’s mother included:• An incident in December 2014 when she was attacked by an unknownassailant, causing her to go into premature labor with the child• In March 2015 the child was diagnosed with pneumonia after havingproblems breathing at the baby sitter’s home• A few days later the child was admitted to Nemours/Alfred I. DuPontHospital for Children with a stomach virus. Medical personnel found a bruise onhis cheek, which was reportedly caused by the child being dropped six inchesinto the crib and his face landing on the baby monitor.• More recently the child was hit on the head by a can of beans thataccidentally rolled off the counter at the local grocery store, causing a bruiseon the child’s forehead.The child has two older siblings who were residing in the family’s home at the timeof the incident.

Thelocal police department interviewed the mother at the hospital. She initiallyadmitted to dropping the child, but then changed her story and said that sheaccidentally hit the victim’s head on the edge of a bathtub.
