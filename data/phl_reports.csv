On the date of incident, the child was admitted to the hospital due to seizures.  The seizures were a result of “water intoxication” from the improper mixture of her formula by her parents.  Neither parent was able to describe appropriate formula preparation to hospital staff.  The child’s sodium levels were dangerously low and her weight was in the zero percentile at the time of admission.  A home assessment was completed two days after the date of the incident, and DHS found the home to be in “deplorable condition.”   The child has a two-year old sister, who was placed in an emergency shelter by DHS after the date of incident.  DHS first became involved with this family when the mother tested positive for marijuana use when giving birth to the sibling in December 2010.  The home was assessed and was determined to be safe and adequately prepared for the arrival of the infant.  The family was offered Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Services (for maternal substance abuse issues) but the mother declined.  The final assessment determined that the infant was safe in the home and the case was closed in mid-December 2010.  A second GPS report was received in January 2013 when the mother tested positive for marijuana at the time of the victim child’s birth.  The mother admitted that two weeks prior to giving birth to the victim child, the mother ingested cupcakes and brownies made with marijuana at her birthday party.  The report was investigated and findings were present; however, the mother ingested the marijuana-laced food at someone else’s home.  The family home was assessed and no safety threats were identified.  The case was closed in February 2013. There are no criminal charges at this time.","2013"

The child and 22 of his peers were taken for an outing to a city pool. Thedaycare had knowledge that the child and some of his peers could not swim. Thedaycare staff had received water safety training from the American Red Cross two daysprior to the outing. Three trips had to be made in order to transport all of the children tothe pool. The daycare staff stated that they assumed none of the children could swimso they grouped all of the children in the shallow end of the pool. There was no dividerbetween shallow and deep ends of the pool. Three to four lifeguards were present andon duty at the time of the incident. At one point there was three staff for 21 children inthe pool, which is short of the 6:1 ratio required by child care regulations. The child wasnoticed to be missing once the daycare director arrived back on site and did a headcount of the children. The child was pulled from the bottom of the pool, provided CPR,and transported to a local hospital where he later passed away.

Philadelphia Department of Human Services substantiated the case in Sept. 2013, naming a babysitter as a perpetrator.  The babysitter stated that the child fell out of her crib on the evening of Aug. 9, 2013 around 11 pm.  The babysitter gave inconsistent information regarding whether or not the child was conscious and breathing when he discovered her.  The babysitter called his paramour, who told him to contact 911.  The babysitter’s paramour went to the father’s home and notified him about the child.  When the babysitter’s paramour and the father arrived at the babysitter’s home the father instructed the babysitter to contact 911.  Neither the babysitter nor the babysitter’s paramour contacted 911 until father arrived at the babysitter’s home.  The babysitter claimed he did not call 911 immediately because the child was responsive and he wanted the paramour to arrive at the home to watch their son while he went to the hospital.  The police were dispatched to the babysitter’s home on Aug. 10 at approximately 12:25 am.  Upon arrival to the hospital, the child was intubated and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  The hospital determined that the child had a subdural hematoma and significant swelling to the brain.  The father had to be removed from the hospital after throwing a chair in the waiting room.  The mother did not come to the hospital until 3:00 am.  The investigation revealed that the child’s injuries were consistent with the explanation of the child falling out of the crib. The child also had a broken collar bone which was consistent with the fall.  However, the child’s condition worsened as a result of not receiving timely medical care.  There was at least an hour and half between when the babysitter discovered the child on the floor and the time that the child arrived at the hospital.  The child now requires a feeding tube and only has peripheral vision.  The child was discharged from the hospital on Nov. 6, 2013, and is now receiving rehabilitation services and attending a medical daycare.  The hospital also noted that the child had bruises to her left torso and right toenail, a blister on the left heel, and diaper rash; however, the mother provided reasonable explanations for these injuries.  Philadelphia Department of Human Services received a separate general report from the hospital on Sept. 9, 2013, after they discovered a healed burn on the child’s left arm.  The mother stated that the child was burned approximately 8 months ago when the child brushed up against a heater.  The report alleged that the parents made two doctor’s appointments to have the burn treated, but did not take the child.  The mother said she treated the burn with ointment.  Although Philadelphia Department of Human Services determined that the parents did not seek medical treatment for the child’s burn, the condition of the burn did not worsen as a result, and has now healed completely.  The child has a three-year-old sister who was examined and determined to be in good health.  Philadelphia Department of Human Services has placed the child and her sibling with a paternal aunt due to concerns for neglect and domestic violence between the parents.  The mother and father have supervised visits.  The family is currently receiving case management services, and both parents were referred to counseling.  Philadelphia Department of Human Services also assessed the safety of the babysitter’s one-year-old male child, who did not show any signs of abuse or neglect.  He was placed with a grandmother while the case was under investigation, but has since returned home, and no services are being provided to his family.

The Philadelphia Department of Human Services (DHS) substantiated the case in April 2014 naming the mother as the perpetrator. The child was born with an endocrine disorder that required her to take cortisone. When the child is ill, she requires higher dosages of the medication, including a shot of cortisone if she is very ill. The child became sick and threw up while at home on March 1, 2014. The mother, who is a nurse, left the child in the care of the aunt so the mother could go to work. The mother did not give the child a higher dosage of cortisone prior to leaving and the aunt was not knowledgeable about the child’s medical condition, only that she took medication. The child continued to vomit and when the mother returned home the child was in shock and had a blood sugar level of 28 (a normal range is 110-200.) At this point the mother should have given the child a shot of cortisone. The mother brought the child to the hospital, where the child was diagnosed with an elevated blood pressure, low blood sugar, and was in adrenal shock. The child was also having difficulty breathing. The mother admitted to hospital staff that the child’s cortisone shot had expired and that she never got a refill. Additionally, through the investigation, it was determined that the mother had poor follow-up care with the hospital that had originally been treating the child. The child was last seen by that hospital in Jan. 2013 but she should have been having quarterly exams. The child was also to receive a neurologic exam prior to this incident but the mother did not follow through with setting up an appointment for the child. The child was discharged from the hospital on March 10, 2014, and DHS filed an Order of Protection and took custody of the child. The child was placed in the kinship care of her godmother and godfather at that time. This family has received education and was given instructions on the child’s necessary medical care. At the time of the incident the child had been residing with her mother, maternal aunt, and a maternal grandfather. She has an older brother, age 8, who also resided in the home. A safety plan was put into place for the older brother that the maternal aunt and grandfather would assist the mother in caring for the brother as he does not have any medical issues. In-home services are being provided to the mother to assist with truancy concerns with the brother. The godparents are supervising all visits between the mother and the victim child.
