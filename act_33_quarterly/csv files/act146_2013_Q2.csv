near fatality,Philadelphia,"7. A 6 year old male child nearly died on April 7, 2013 as a result of medical neglect.Philadelphia Department of Human Services substantiated the case in May 2013,naming the mother as the perpetrator. The victim child’s condition started when he wasin the care of his father in the afternoon on the date of incident. The child had a coldthat weekend. The mother sent the child to the father’s home with cold medicine and aninhaler, which he normally uses for ongoing asthma symptoms. The child also hasknown allergies to peanuts and carrots. Around 2:00 pm on the date of incident, thefather noticed that the child was having difficulty breathing. The child was given acouple puffs from the inhaler and then took his cold medicine. The child threw up about20 minutes later. The father initially decided to take the child to the Emergency Room,but then decided against it because he did not have the child’s medical insuranceinformation. Instead, the father called the maternal grandmother to get the medicalinsurance information. The maternal grandmother told the father to bring the childhome (as the mother lives in the maternal grandmother’s home) and they would takethe child to the hospital. The father brought the child to the mother’s home around 4:00pm on the date of incident. The stepfather was at the mother’s home to receive thechild. The father and the mother do not interact directly due to fighting with each other.The father reports that the child appeared to be doing better and was asleep when they2013 2nd Quarter FatalitiesApril 1 – June 30 2013 11arrived at the mother’s home. The mother and child arrived at the hospital atapproximately 6:45 pm.The hospital determined that the child suffered a severe allergic reaction, includingswelling and difficulty breathing. Medical professionals involved in this case reportedthat the allergic reaction could have been fatal due to the mother’s delay in seekingmedical treatment for the child. The mother failed to act in a timely manner in gettingthe child medical care which resulted in the child suffering severe respiratory distressthat almost killed him. The investigation determined that instead of taking the child tothe hospital right away, the mother videotaped the child answering questions that shewas asking about the child’s condition. The mother also did not provide the father thechild’s medical insurance information or fill a prescription for a new nebulizer to replacethe broken one the child had been using. The mother chose to take the child to ahospital a distance from home rather than calling an ambulance to come get child.When asked about this decision, the mother stated that she felt that she could get childto the hospital faster than an ambulance. The maternal grandmother will ensure thatthe mother keeps all future medical appointments and gives the child all prescribedmedicines. A relative who lives in the father’s home will ensure that the father is alsoproviding proper medical care for the child. There are no other children in the home.The family was not known to Philadelphia Department of Human Services division ofChildren and Youth Services prior to this report."

near fatality,Philadelphia,"11.  A four month old female child nearly died on June 17, 2013 due to failure to thrive.   Philadelphia Department of Human Services (DHS) substantiated the report in July 2013, naming both the mother and the father as perpetrators of neglect.  On the date of incident, the child was admitted to the hospital due to seizures.  The seizures were a result of “water intoxication” from the improper mixture of her formula by her parents.  Neither parent was able to describe appropriate formula preparation to hospital staff.  The child’s sodium levels were dangerously low and her weight was in the zero percentile at the time of admission.  A home assessment was completed two days after the date of the incident, and DHS found the home to be in “deplorable condition.”   The child has a two-year old sister, who was placed in an emergency shelter by DHS after the date of incident.  DHS first became involved with this family when the mother tested positive for marijuana use when giving birth to the sibling in December 2010.  The home was assessed and was determined to be safe and adequately prepared for the arrival of the infant.  The family was offered Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Services (for maternal substance abuse issues) but the mother declined.  The final assessment determined that the infant was safe in the home and the case was closed in mid-December 2010.  A second GPS report was received in January 2013 when the mother tested positive for marijuana at the time of the victim child’s birth.  The mother admitted that two weeks prior to giving birth to the victim child, the mother ingested cupcakes and brownies made with marijuana at her birthday party.  The report was investigated and findings were present; however, the mother ingested the marijuana-laced food at someone else’s home.  The family home was assessed and no safety threats were identified.  The case was closed in February 2013. There are no criminal charges at this time."
