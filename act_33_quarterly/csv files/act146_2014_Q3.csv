She was2014 3rd Quarter Fatalities/Near Fatalities 13July 1 – September 30 2014seen again at 3-months-old for an MRI and was doing well. At that time the doctor requestedthe child be seen again at approximately 1-year-old to assess any development of the tumor.The mass could grow and compromise the child’s heart function and ability to breathe. The mother didn’t take the child for a follow-up until Nov. 2013. After several cancellations of thepre-MRI appointment with an anesthesiologist, the child was finally seen for pre-operativeevaluation but never brought back for the MRI. In Apr. 2014 the mother called CHOPrequesting the child be seen due to difficulty breathing, having fevers, and not eating. Themother was instructed to immediately take the child to the local emergency room. Medical stafffrom CHOP followed up and the mother told them the child had been seen at a local urgentcare facility, she had a viral illness and was under the care of her pediatrician. There is norecord of the child being seen by urgent care or the pediatrician. At the request of CHOP thechild was brought to their office at which time she was admitted. Testing revealed a “hugeanterior multilobulated cystic mediastinal mass” compressing her heart. The child was noted tobe ASA Status 4 defined as an “incapacitating disease that is a constant threat to life”.

On May 12, 2014, a four hour surgery removed the tumor which the surgeondescribed as the largest mass he had seen in his 25 year pediatric career. Post-operativerecovery was difficult noting a deep vein thrombosis which required painful injections ofLovenox twice daily for treatment of the clot. In addition to the twice daily injections, dischargeinstructions included lab work crucial to ensuring the proper levels of Lovenox. The child wasreleased from the hospital on May 20, 2014, with an appointment scheduled for June 2, 2014,with a local pediatrician.

There was no record of lab work which was to have beendone on June 2, 2014, for CHOP to monitor the blood clot. An MRI was conducted on June 11,2014, with a post-procedure appointment scheduled with the doctor the same afternoon. Themother did not take the child to that follow-up appointment.
