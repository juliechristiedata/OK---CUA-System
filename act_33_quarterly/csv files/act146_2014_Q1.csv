fatality,Fayette,"5. A 1-year-old female child died on Nov. 15, 2013, as a result of physical abuse. Fayette County Children and Youth Services (FCCYS) indicated the report on Jan. 18, 2014, naming both parents as perpetrators of abuse. The child was taken to the Uniontown Hospital on the morning of Nov. 15, 2013, because the mother said she wasn’t “acting right” and had been vomiting since the previous day. Upon examination the child was found to have multiple bruises to the center of her abdomen and left side and her stomach was distended. The parents denied any knowledge of how the injuries occurred claiming the child woke up in that condition. She was intubated and transferred to Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHOP) by medical helicopter where an examination found the child’s liver and spleen were both lacerated. Emergency surgery was performed but could not save the child’s life at which time a report was made to ChildLine. FCCYS immediately conducted a safety assessment where it was determined the three siblings were not safe in the home and were placed in foster care. On Dec. 4, 2013, the children were transferred to the care of their maternal great grandparents who were assessed and approved as appropriate caregivers by FCCYS. Prior to this incident, FCCYS had received five reports involving this family. A report was made in Jan. 2013 alleging that one of the children had informed the caller of a thumb sized bruise received when the mother hit the child on the arm. This report was screened out. A report was made in Feb. 2013 alleging the mother left her 9-month-old child unattended in a shopping cart for approximately 10 minutes. A wide burn was also bserved on the child’s hand. The report was screened out. On May 10, 2013, a Child Protective Services report (CPS) was received alleging the 4-year-old was on the porch roof grabbing onto power lines while the mother was inside the house and the father was outside working on his car. FCCYS and a Luzerne Township police officer immediately responded to the home. There were no potential safety threats identified and the children were deemed safe. On May 14, 2013, while working on the previous CPS report from May 10, 2013, another CPS report was made alleging the parents are physically and verbally abusive toward the children and that the children are always unsupervised. The caller stated that a few weeks prior to making this report, the 1-year-old fell down six or seven steps outside when the mother wasn’t watching her and had “bruises and knots” on her head.  The mother stated to the caller that she didn’t want to take her child to the doctor. The caller also referred to allegations in the May 10, 2013, CPS report and added that the children go near a busy road, that the 3-year-old nearly “went under” a running lawn mower after the father walked away, claimed the father buys and sells pills, that the home has no running water and no food. This report was immediately responded to by FCCYS and a Luzerne Township Police officer where all children were seen and no threats were identified.  Both reports were unfounded on June 4, 2013. A report made on Oct. 30, 2013, alleged the family moved “constantly” and the parents were blowing the children’s SSI money on drugs. An immediate response was made but the home was empty as the family had moved. An additional attempt was made to locate the family on Nov. 5, 2013, including a visit to the oldest sibling at school. A new address for the family was given to FCCYS during that visit. FCCYS went to the new address leaving a note on the door for the family to call the caseworker. A neighbor contacted FCCYS saying they believed the family had moved from that home to another home nearby. On Nov. 14, 2013, after repeated attempts, FCCYS was unable to locate the new residence. FCCYS was contacted on Nov. 15, 2013, by the school to express concerns regarding the oldest sibling’s attendance and late arrivals and a new address for the family was obtained. Later that morning, FCCYS was informed that the victim child was in the emergency room at Uniontown Hospital. The father was arrested and charged with criminal homicide and endangering the welfare of children. He is currently incarcerated. The mother was charged with one count of endangering the welfare of children, pled guilty, then withdrew her plea and is awaiting trial.

On the date of incident, emergency services received a 911 call from the perpetrator stating that his daughter had fallen down a wooden stair case and was unresponsive. Emergency responders arrived at the home and stabilized the victim child for transport via ambulance to a local hospital. After initial testing at the hospital the victim was transported via helicopter to a children’s hospital for further testing and treatment. The test results revealed that she sustained severe brain trauma with diffuse, extensive bilateral retinal hemorrhaging, a clavicle fracture, epidural hemorrhaging at the level of the cervical spine, multiple bruises all over her body, and seizures despite treatment with anti-seizure medication. When asked to explain what caused the injuries to the child the father stated she fell down a flight of wooden stairs. He stated that on the day of the incident two of his children were visiting with him at his home, which he shares with his mother. He stated that he and both children were in his attic bedroom playing when he decided to put on a movie. He then reports that he turned his back to put on a movie when he heard “thuds” from the staircase. After running towards the victim child he found her at the bottom of the steps. The perpetrator states that the child initially seemed fine, but eventually went limp and became unresponsive. He reports that he screamed for his brother, who is 10 years old and was home at the time, to come help. The younger brother brought in some water and reportedly screamed at the older brother to call 911. The doctor who treated the victim child at the children’s hospital stated in the report that “these injuries are unequivocally the result of child abuse.  A stair fall could not result in this constellation of injuries.” The victim child’s father states that he did not harm the child and the fall was an accident. After the initial report was received by Cambria County CYS a safety plan was implemented in which the perpetrator’s two other children would have no contact with him during the investigation. Each sibling lives primarily with their biological mother and CYS has no safety concerns for the children while in their mothers’ care. It was recommended to the mother of the perpetrator’s other child, who was with him at the time of incident, that she consent to a full skeletal survey, which she has stated she will not do based on the advice of the perpetrator’s attorney. The safety plan also stated that the perpetrator is to have no contact with his 10 year old brother, who lived in the same home. Police arrested the victim child’s father and charged him with two counts of aggravated assault and one count of endangering the welfare of a child. He is currently incarcerated while awaiting trial.  If the perpetrator is able to post bail he is required to stay with his aunt as there are no children in her home. The Cambria County District Attorney’s Office placed a bail condition on the perpetrator that he is not to have contact with anyone under the age of 18.  The only prior CYS involvement was when the perpetrator was a child. Those reports have all been expunged and there are no current records on file related to this family."

Emergency room doctors noted the victim child had injuries to his forehead,cheeks, scrotum, left knee, and pelvic area, a laceration found under his tongue andseveral smaller bruises were found on his lower back. The mother’s paramour waswatching the child in the evening while she worked third shift and he arrived at thehospital with the child. When the paramour was questioned regarding the incident hestated that he went to check on the child and found him unconscious and not breathing.2014 1st Quarter Fatalities/Near Fatalities 14January 1 – March 31 2013At that time the paramour called 911 and began administering CPR. The caseworkerinvestigating the incident reviewed the child’s medical records and discovered that thechild had also been taken to the emergency room in Feb. 2014 after he fell off the topbunk bed. At that time the child was air lifted to the emergency room as a result of thatincident where records show he had suffered a subdural hematoma. The paramournoted to doctors that the child’s eyes were rolling into the back of his head and that hisarms and legs were jerking everywhere after he fell. The hospital staff noted that theaccount for the injuries seemed plausible so no further action was taken. Thecaseworker noted that no bone scan had been completed for the Feb. incident and nophone call was placed to CYS. Two days after being discharged from the hospital forthe Feb. incident the mother’s paramour reported that the child was not walkingproperly; he stated that the child then became rigid and fell on his face without puttinghis arms out to break the fall. The mother checked on the child after he fell and foundthat he was still conscious and alert. The paramour stated that he called the hospitalthree times that day but was instructed not to bring the child to the hospital, but ratherwait until the follow up appointment at the end of March. The paramour then tookpictures of the child’s eyes to show doctors that the pupils were not the same size.There was no other medical activity with the child until he was transported to theemergency room in March after he stopped breathing and became unconscious. It wasduring the trip to the emergency room that the bruises noted above were found as wellas an unexplained spiral fracture to the child’s left leg which doctors stated was mostlikely suffered at the beginning of Feb. based on the stage of healing. The caseworkerspoke with the mother’s paramour, both of the paramour’s parents, and the child’sbiological father during the investigation. It was revealed that the mother frequentlysleeps and leaves the child unattended which puts him in potentially harmful situations.When the caseworker went to speak with the mother regarding the incident it was notedthat the mother showed no engagement or willingness to cooperate with theinvestigation. The family was known to Schuylkill County Children and Youth Servicesfrom reports received the previous year in which the mother was said to be violent,depressed, and asleep all day. The same report stated that the mother put the child onthe top bunk bed to detain him. Schuylkill County Children and Youth Services madecontact with the mother regarding this incident and discussed appropriate sleepingarrangements and supervision and closed the case. Based on the information receivedin the current investigation, Lebanon County CYS placed the child in foster care. Due tothe biological father’s current and ongoing legal issues he was ruled out as anappropriate caregiver for the child. Based off family finding results, CYS is working withthe paternal aunt for possible kinship placement. The victim is the perpetrator’s onlychild.

When the child is ill, she requires higher dosages of the medication, including a shot of cortisone if she is very ill. The child became sick and threw up while at home on March 1, 2014. The mother, who is a nurse, left the child in the care of the aunt so the mother could go to work. The mother did not give the child a higher dosage of cortisone prior to leaving and the aunt was not knowledgeable about the child’s medical condition, only that she took medication. The child continued to vomit and when the mother returned home the child was in shock and had a blood sugar level of 28 (a normal range is 110-200.) At this point the mother should have given the child a shot of cortisone. The mother brought the child to the hospital, where the child was diagnosed with an elevated blood pressure, low blood sugar, and was in adrenal shock. The child was also having difficulty breathing. The mother admitted to hospital staff that the child’s cortisone shot had expired and that she never got a refill.

The child was last seen by that hospital in Jan. 2013 but she should have been having quarterly exams. The child was also to receive a neurologic exam prior to this incident but the mother did not follow through with setting up an appointment for the child.
