Mother is scheduled for a jury trial in July 2013.   The family was open with the agency at the time of this incident.  Services were being provided due to allegations of the mother physically abusing the 15 yr old daughter in September 2012.  The family was receiving in-home crisis services.  The agency confirmed that the mother was also participating in a dual diagnosis treatment program.  The twins’ father is currently incarcerated at a state correctional facility.

This child’s father passed away in 2006.  The 15 year old and the twins were the only children in mother’s care when the fire occurred.  The mother’s 13 year old daughter resides with her father and stepmother.  The mother’s seven year old daughter has been residing with her father since 2005.  Allegheny County CYS has had involvement with this family dating back to 2005 when the 15 year old and 13 year old were removed from their mother’s care due to neglect and substance abuse issues.

fatality,Allegheny,"3.  A one year old male child died on March 2, 2013.  The cause and manner of the child’s death are unknown at this time.  The Western Region Office of Children, Youth, and Families substantiated the report for medical neglect in April 2013 and listed the child’s maternal aunt, a maternal female cousin, and the maternal aunt’s paramour as perpetrators.  The victim child and his twin brother had sustained chemical burns.  The victim child also had scratches on various parts of his body.  Inconsistent reports have been provided by the caregivers as to how and when the children sustained the burns.  It has been reported that the children were sleeping in their crib and the victim child soiled himself.  The victim child and his sibling were removed from the crib and the crib and bedding were cleaned with bleach.  The victim child and his sibling were then placed back into the crib.  The children started to cry and were removed from the crib and placed on the living room floor with their eight year old brother and their six year old cousin.  The maternal female cousin’s two children (ages two and 23 months) were also on the floor sleeping.  The boys were propped up on pillows.  The caregivers allegedly noticed the victim child had redness to his stomach.  The maternal aunt left the home to go drinking and left the boys in the care of her paramour and the maternal cousin.  The mother was notified by the maternal aunt that there had been an incident in the home involving bleach but the boys were fine.  The mother then came to the home hours later (around 5:00 am) and saw the victim child unresponsive.  It was reported that all three caregivers were under the influence of marijuana.  The mother was determined to be under the influence of alcohol.  The aunt’s paramour called an ambulance to the home at approximately 6:00 am on March 2 because the victim child was found unresponsive.  The victim child was already deceased when the ambulance arrived and was taken directly to the medical examiner’s office.  The sibling was taken to the hospital, where he was admitted and treated for his injuries.  The investigation determined that the caregivers initially considered notifying emergency personnel but had decided not to.  The county has been involved with the family for various reasons since 2008.  The mother has a history of inpatient mental health hospitalizations, outpatient psychotherapy, and substance abuse evaluations.  The father was incarcerated prior to this incident due to drug-related issues.  Most recently, the county became involved due to the mother making threats of self-harm, and allegations of substance abuse.  The county opened services with the family in April 2012.  The children were placed in the care of their maternal aunt at the beginning of Oct. 2012 due to being left home alone by the mother.  The county then removed the boys from the maternal aunt’s home after determining she had previously been convicted on a child endangerment charge.  Despite the aunt’s criminal record, a judge  ordered the children back into the care of the maternal aunt after a hearing on Oct. 12, 2012.  Due to the aunt’s criminal conviction, she was unable to become a licensed kinship provider.  The county was providing oversight of the boys and their placement in the aunt’s home at the time of the incident.  There have not been any charges filed in this report pending the final autopsy report.   "

The report was unfounded; however, the case was accepted for services due to mental health concerns with the parents, supervision issues, and the need for basic parenting skills.
