The child was later transferred to a pediatrichospital. Amagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was taken of the child’s cervical spine, whichrevealed that the child had ligamentous injury of the upper cervical and spine andsome cerebral soft tissue swelling, suggesting that she was shaken. The child alsohad ecchymosis of the oral cavity, two labial tears, one perianal tear, and a wart orskin tag on her rectum. The parents provided no explanation for the injuries to thechild.The hospital also conducted a full evaluation on the child’s twin and older sibling.The child’s twin was also found to have injuries including a left femoral fracture anda buckle fracture of the tibia.

Bucks County Children and Youth Social Services Agency (BucksCYSSA) indicated the case on April 6, 2016, naming the father’s paramour as theperpetrator. On February 13, 2016, the child was brought to a local hospital by herfather’s paramour, who reported that she put the child down on the bed as she wasgoing to tend to her 6-year-old and 3-year-old sons who had started fighting. Asshe exited the room, she heard a thud and turned around to see the child had fallenoff the bed, which was about 21 inches off of the floor. The father’s paramourstated that the child cried, but recovered quickly and seemed fine so she continuedwith her plans and took the children to the barber shop. She later noticed the childwas very “loopy” and was drifting in and out. The father’s paramour felt that thechild needed to be seen at the hospital and contacted him to notify him of herconcern. Surveillance footage shows that there was a delay in the child receivingmedical care upon arrival at the hospital as the father’s paramour parked her car inthe parking lot rather than immediately taking the child into the emergency room.The child’s father arrived at the hospital shortly after the child and his paramour.Hospital staff performed CPR on the child and intubated her. She was thentransferred to a pediatric hospital via helicopter. The child was treated for asubdural hemorrhage, a retinal hemorrhage in her right eye, an injury to the tissuein her brain caused by a lack of oxygen and blood circulation, and swelling to thesoft tissue and ligaments of her neck. The child abuse physician stated that thechild’s injuries were consistent with inflicted trauma and were a result ofacceleration and deceleration forces along with shaking and impact, such as with aserious car accident or a television falling on a child’s head. During theinvestigation, conflicting accounts of what may have happened to the child werereported. A witness reported seeing the father’s paramour holding the child underher arms, while sitting on the bed. The paramour was “flipping” the child and itlooked like “she got hurt.” This same witness also reported that the mother’sparamour had provided a story to someone about what happened to the child thatwas different than what this person had witnessed.Since the child’s initial hospitalization, she has improved and is now breathing onher own and responding to light although she remains unable to track objects withher eyes or hold her head up on her own. In March 2016, the child was transferredto a specialized facility to begin rehabilitation and on April 27, 2016, she wasreturned to the care of her mother.

She had been seizing2016 2nd Quarter Fatalities/Near Fatalities Page 15April 1 – June 30, 2016and needed to be intubated. She was diagnosed with dehydration and failure tothrive. Her eyes were drifting to the left and not tracking, she had no head control,and her head appeared large. Both parents stated the child was doing fine until twodays prior, when she stopped eating. It was confirmed during the investigation thatthe parents were taking the child to her appointments scheduled. The lastappointment was on March 8, 2016; the notes indicated that the child wasdehydrated, had poor head control and the doctor suggested that the parentsincrease feeding to help her gain weight. On March 24, 2016, a chest x-ray andcomputerized tomography scan of her head were completed. The child had thefollowing injuries: twenty-nine healed or healing rib fractures, a well healedcollarbone fracture, a well healed tibia fracture, a compression fracture of the spine,several areas of blood inside and outside of her brain, blood in her neck and spine,and at least four skull fractures.The child is still in the hospitalin outpatient rehabilitation and is being fed through anasogastric tube and has to be in a cervical collar for at least the next threemonths. The criminal investigation is ongoing at this time as neither parent hasadmitted to harming the child, although they are the only two people who wereresponsible for her care. Both parents feel that her injuries could be due to a fallfrom the couch, which took place four or five days prior to the referral beingreceived. The parents also feel that they could have been caused by the father’sseven-year-old daughter (who resides with her mother and visits sporadically).Both of these scenarios however would not explain the child’s injuries.Both parents have since stopped cooperating with the agency and law enforcementand are refusing to provide any statements or further explanation.

The fatherstated he went to take his daughter to the hospital but his vehicle would not start.Given the child seemed fine to the father, he spent the next four hours fixing hisvehicle. There was no cell phone coverage and a house phone had not yet beeninstalled, so he was unable to call for assistance.

Lancaster County Children and Youth Agency (Lancaster CYA)indicated the case on June 17, 2016, naming the child’s mother and father as theperpetrators. The child was taken to a local hospital on April 20, 2016, by hisparents after they had initially taken him to his primary care physician, whoinformed the parents that they needed to take the child to the hospital due to theseverity of his condition. It was initially reported by the parents that the child wasexperiencing severe respiratory issues for two days prior to arrival at the hospital.The parents seemed reluctant to take the child to the hospital, but did comply afterbeing informed that a required call would be placed to child protective services ifthey did not. The child was transferred to a pediatric hospital that same day forfurther evaluation and testing. The child has a history of genetic issues whichimpact the functioning of the child’s immune system, the majority of which wereunknown to both hospitals upon admission. Initially, medical staff did not appear tohave concern or question the parents’ care of the child as it would not beuncommon to wait a couple days to see if the child’s condition improves prior toseeking medical treatment. However, during further information gathering andfollow up with the family, medical staff began to piece together a concerningpattern as this was not the child’s first admission at the hospital. Medical personnelbegan to sense the parents were not disclosing the entire history or background ofthe child’s medical needs. A treating doctor contacted The Clinic for Special Children(Clinic) regarding possible outpatient treatment and follow-up. The hospital wasinformed by the Clinic that the child had been a patient with them for years and thechild was prescribed a medication for an immune deficiency. The parents were notproviding the child the medication as required which was making him extremelyvulnerable to infectious diseases. The child’s lack of medication for his medicalcondition has a direct correlation with why he continues to become ill and presentwith diagnoses such as pneumonia and bacterial infections.Lancaster CYA completed safety assessments on the child’s four siblings and had noconcerns for their safety while in the care of their parents. The child also remains inthe care of his parents. Lancaster CYA has opened the family for ongoing generalprotective services. The major area of focus is to monitor and assist the family toensure the child is receiving appropriate medical care and follow-up based on hismedical condition.

On this same date, a secondphysical examination revealed tenderness and swelling to both right and left scalps,and minor facial abrasions. The child’s head computerized tomography scan and 3Dreconstruction revealed a fracture of the right and left parietal bone with adepressed fragment, and subdural hemorrhages. The child’s fracture patterncorrelates to significant application of force, either by a direct contact injury or fromrotational cranial acceleration/deceleration and then subsequent impact. Thephysician noted that the child’s symptoms would have occurred immediately andwould have likely included crying, irritability, and a change in mental status. Thechild’s mother reported no issues were relayed from the paternal great-grandparents who were caring for the child the previous night.
