The child’s arm was stiff and when he picked upthe child, he vomited. The maternal uncle called the maternal aunt and when she2016 1st Quarter Fatalities/Near FatalitiesJanuary 1 – March 31, 2016 10arrived home, they took the child to Sewickley Valley Hospital around 6:30 PM. Thechild was in an altered mental status and was found to have sustained an acuteintracranial subdural hemorrhage. The child was then transferred via ambulance toChildren’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP). Upon arrival, the child was placed into thePediatric Intensive Care Unit. This incident was not registered as a near fatality until February 5, 2016. The treating physicians at CHP determined the child’s injurywas the result of being shaken. The treating physician believes the child hadbleeding on the brain which resulted in a seizure causing the child to fall down thestairs. On February 4, 2016, to ensure the safety of the child’s 9-year-old sibling,he was moved out of the kinship home and into the foster home where he residedprior to his placement in the kinship home. The child’s sibling participated in aforensic interview, but did not disclose witnessing any abuse. The child wasreleased from the hospital and placed into the same foster home as his sibling. Heis receiving early intervention services and occupational therapy on a weekly basis.Both the biological family and the kinship family had prior involvement with AOCYF.The biological family has a history of supervision concerns and the child’s half-sisterdisclosed sexual abuse by the mother’s paramour who was convicted for thesesexual offenses. The half-sister now lives with her father. Beaver CYS had priorinvolvement with the family. There were referrals regarding the mother’s mentalstability and concerns for inappropriate physical discipline. The mother wasindicated for physical abuse on one child. In addition, she was indicated for sexualabuse by omission when the child’s older half-brothers disclosed sexual abuse bythe mother’s friend. The kinship family had prior involvement with AOCYF in 2009when allegations were made that the second oldest child had sustained a black eyeand the four eldest children were sexually acting out. There was no evidence tosubstantiate these allegations. In 2012 a referral alleged there was no food in thehome and the children were sleeping on the floor. In addition, it was alleged thatthe aunt had mental health issues and the uncle was an alcoholic. The countyagency could not find any safety issues to substantiate this report, and this reportwas unfounded. The criminal investigation is still ongoing regarding the near fatalityreport."
