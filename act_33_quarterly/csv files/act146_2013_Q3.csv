The mother and father brought the child to their local hospital on July 18 due to vomiting and lethargy.  The child was observed to have bruises covering her face, head, and extremities.  She was also diagnosed as having a subdural hemorrhage, ligament injury in her back, extensive bilateral retinal hemorrhaging, and a healing rib fracture.  The father admitted to police that, approximately two weeks prior, he had spun the child around in circles on the floor and the child hit her head off of a door frame.  Child did have bruising to her head at that time but neither parent sought medical treatment for the child.  The father has also admitted to severely bruising the child’s legs by squeezing them hard when she would cry.  He would grab her cheeks hard when trying to feed her, slap her in the face, and punch her with his fists.  The mother admitted to police that she witnessed the child hit her head after being spun around; saw the bruising; but did not get the child medical attention.  The mother stated she saw the father drop the child from a height of approximately four feet and the child landed on her head.  Again, the mother did not seek medical attention.  The mother claims that the child was once stepped on by another adult male in the home and did not get child medical attention despite her family advising her to do so.  The mother also admitted to knowing that the father would forcefully feed the child on several occasions.  The child and her three siblings were removed from the home after this incident.  The child was placed into a medical foster home due to her need for ongoing medical care.  Her two year old sister was placed into a separate foster home.

near fatality,Philadelphia,"11) A one and a half year old female child nearly died on Aug. 10, 2013 due to medical neglect.  Philadelphia Department of Human Services substantiated the case in Sept. 2013, naming a babysitter as a perpetrator.  The babysitter stated that the child fell out of her crib on the evening of Aug. 9, 2013 around 11 pm.  The babysitter gave inconsistent information regarding whether or not the child was conscious and breathing when he discovered her.  The babysitter called his paramour, who told him to contact 911.  The babysitter’s paramour went to the father’s home and notified him about the child.  When the babysitter’s paramour and the father arrived at the babysitter’s home the father instructed the babysitter to contact 911.  Neither the babysitter nor the babysitter’s paramour contacted 911 until father arrived at the babysitter’s home.  The babysitter claimed he did not call 911 immediately because the child was responsive and he wanted the paramour to arrive at the home to watch their son while he went to the hospital.  The police were dispatched to the babysitter’s home on Aug. 10 at approximately 12:25 am.  Upon arrival to the hospital, the child was intubated and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  The hospital determined that the child had a subdural hematoma and significant swelling to the brain.  The father had to be removed from the hospital after throwing a chair in the waiting room.  The mother did not come to the hospital until 3:00 am.  The investigation revealed that the child’s injuries were consistent with the explanation of the child falling out of the crib. The child also had a broken collar bone which was consistent with the fall.  However, the child’s condition worsened as a result of not receiving timely medical care.  There was at least an hour and half between when the babysitter discovered the child on the floor and the time that the child arrived at the hospital.  The child now requires a feeding tube and only has peripheral vision.  The child was discharged from the hospital on Nov. 6, 2013, and is now receiving rehabilitation services and attending a medical daycare.  The hospital also noted that the child had bruises to her left torso and right toenail, a blister on the left heel, and diaper rash; however, the mother provided reasonable explanations for these injuries.  Philadelphia Department of Human Services received a separate general report from the hospital on Sept. 9, 2013, after they discovered a healed burn on the child’s left arm.  The mother stated that the child was burned approximately 8 months ago when the child brushed up against a heater.  The report alleged that the parents made two doctor’s appointments to have the burn treated, but did not take the child.  The mother said she treated the burn with ointment.  Although Philadelphia Department of Human Services determined that the parents did not seek medical treatment for the child’s burn, the condition of the burn did not worsen as a result, and has now healed completely.  The child has a three-year-old sister who was examined and determined to be in good health.  Philadelphia Department of Human Services has placed the child and her sibling with a paternal aunt due to concerns for neglect and domestic violence between the parents.  The mother and father have supervised visits.  The family is currently receiving case management services, and both parents were referred to counseling.  Philadelphia Department of Human Services also assessed the safety of the babysitter’s one-year-old male child, who did not show any signs of abuse or neglect.  He was placed with a grandmother while the case was under investigation, but has since returned home, and no services are being provided to his family.  Neither of the families had a prior history of involvement with Philadelphia Department of Human Services.  There are no criminal charges related to this case at this time. "
near fatality,Union,"12) An eleven month old male child nearly died on July 14, 2013 after receiving trauma to his head leading to seizures.  Union County Children and Youth Services (CYS) indicated the case in Sept. 2013 and named the child’s biological father as the perpetrator.  The father stated the child fell backwards about three feet off of a bed onto the hardwood floor and landed on his head.  When the child began to show signs of losing consciousness his father called 911.  Emergency services transported the child to a local hospital, where he was eventually flown via Life Flight to a larger hospital.  After completing a full evaluation on the child it was determined he was suffering from a subdural hematoma but showed no sign of external trauma or bruising.  A small portion of his skull was removed to relieve the pressure and he was placed on a ventilator and has since recovered.  Physicians at the first hospital the child went to report that the father’s story is plausible, but a neurosurgeon at the second hospital stated the injury was non-accidental trauma to the head.  The family is known in their community and has large support system, including the local church and extended family from out of town that have flown in to help them.  The family has no history with Union County CYS.  When the caseworker went to the home to ensure the safety of the other children, ages four and twelve, it was noted the family lived in a well maintained home along with the maternal grandmother.  The mother and father are married and living in the home as well.  After the child was removed from the ventilator he was transferred to a children’s rehabilitation hospital for a short time and is now back at home.  A safety plan has been put in place in which the father is not to be alone with the children.  The family has hired an attorney where all paperwork is forwarded and has yet to sign the agreement.  The caseworker has seen the family monthly since the incident and reports that the child has been working with an occupational therapist, and is expected to make a full recovery."
near fatality,Westmoreland,"13) A one month old male child nearly died on Sept. 5, 2013 due to multiple injuries caused by physical abuse.

On the evening of Sept. 6, 2013, the father confessed to shaking the child and throwing him on a changing table two days earlier, after the child peed in his face while father was changing the child’s diaper. The father has been charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, endangering the welfare of children, and recklessly endangering another person.  He is now incarcerated.  Due to the child’s young age, the long-term effects of the abuse remain to be seen; however, the child is currently at home with the mother and is doing very well.  There are no other children in the home.  The mother and child moved to Allegheny County in Oct. 2013.  Allegheny County Office of Children, Youth and Families performed an assessment of the current living arrangement and determined that there was not a need for services.
