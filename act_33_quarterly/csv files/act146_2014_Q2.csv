fatality,Somerset,"7. A 1-year-old female child died on Aug. 5, 2011, due to injuries sustained from physical abuse. Somerset County Children & Youth Services founded the case in June 2014 as a result of the criminal convictions of both the mother and her paramour. On the day of the incident emergency services was called to the mother’s home in the early morning hours of August 5, 2011. The child had been found unresponsive and was declared dead at the scene. Her body was taken directly to the coroner’s office for examination. An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be asphyxiation due to compression of the mouth and neck. The child also sustained blunt force trauma to her head and a fractured right radius and right ulna. She had multiple bruises and lacerations on her body. During the investigation, very little information was provided by the mother or her paramour regarding the circumstances of the child’s death. At the time of the incidents the agency provided a case status of pending criminal court due to the ongoing criminal investigation into the child’s death. On April 17, 2012 the mother plead guilty to one count of recklessly endangering another person. She was sentenced to time served. The judge followed the aggravated range guidelines for sentencing as he felt the mother had failed to provide care and protection of the child. At the time of her release, the mother did not have any other children. Her whereabouts are currently unknown. On Feb. 11, 2014, the mother’s paramour entered an Alford plea for the charge of voluntary manslaughter. This plea means that he maintains his innocence but admits that there was enough evidence against him to likely prove he was responsible for the death of the child. He was sentenced to four to12 years in a state correctional facility. The mother and child were not previously known to the county. However her paramour was known to the county in 2010 for physically abusing his former paramour’s son. As a result of pending criminal charges for that incident, the paramour was being monitored by county probation. Somerset County Children and Youth received a second report while the paramour was residing with his then paramour and their newborn son. This referral was closed in July 2011 after the agency determined there were no safety threats. Probation was still monitoring the case at that time and had no concern about the living situation as long as he was being supervised around his child. It is believed that the paramour started to reside with this victim child and her mother sometime in July of 2011."

near fatality,Washington,"14. A 10-month-old male child nearly died on May 5, 2014, due to head injuries sustained during a fall. Washington County Children & Youth Services (WCCYS) substantiated the report in July 2014 naming  a household member caretaker as the perpetrator of child abuse due to a lack of supervision. On the morning of the incident, the father took the oldest sibling to school and asked the household member caretaker, who is the maternal grandmother of the victim child’s half sibling, to watch the victim child and his older half-brother. The child’s mother was upstairs sleeping when the father left. All of the other relatives, who lived in the home, had already left for the day. The caretaker left the children unsupervised in the living room for approximately two minutes to take the garbage out through the sliding glass doors. While she was outside, she heard a thud and then the child crying. The child apparently climbed a flight of stairs and then fell from an unsecured ledge. The caretaker allegedly found the child lying on the floor and noticed that he was not using his right arm. The child appeared to be sleepy. The caretaker woke up the mother and told her to call 911. The child was transported to the hospital via ambulance and then flown to another hospital for treatment. It was determined that the child had a frontal skill fracture, a parietal fracture, a left mastoid bone fracture, and subdural and epidermal bleeding. The child has two half-siblings who are now living with their biological mother in a different residence. The caretaker tested positive for marijuana and moved out of the home after the incident. She is being charged with endangering the welfare of a child by the Washington County Police. The child was discharged from the hospital on May 10, 2014, and is expected to make a full recovery. WCCYS allowed the child to return to the family home on May 11, 2014, after visiting the home to ensure that home was safe and that a railing was installed at the ledge where the child had fallen. WCCYS arranged for drug and alcohol treatment and parenting skills training for the parents, which they successfully completed. The family was not known to the agency prior to this incident.
